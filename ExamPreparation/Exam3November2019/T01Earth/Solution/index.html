                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
                    object known to harbor life. According
                    to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence,
                    Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
                    Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane,
                    producing seasons on Earth. The
                    gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides,
                    stabilizes Earth's orientation on its
                    axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
